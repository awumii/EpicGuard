EpicGuard is a bot protection plugin for minecraft servers, supporting bukkit, bungeecord and velocity enviroments. Highly configurable and customizable.

## Some features

 * Block VPNs and proxies, using the proxycheck.io service (or other api, if you want).
 * Allow or block specific countries/cities.
